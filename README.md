#Project Name
Drug Inventory Management App

#Description
This project will create a Drug Inventory App. The Drug Inventory Management App is designed to provide an efficient solution for tracking and managing drug inventories across multiple pharmacies. With this app, pharmacy owners and administrators can easily monitor and update the availability of various drugs in their inventory. The app allows users to add new drugs, update existing drug information such as name, dose, formulation, and quantity, and delete drugs when necessary, through the use of a form.

This is the front end which will be fetching data from http://localhost:9292/. The initial fetch will bring all of the data about the pharmacies, including the list of drugs each pharmacy contains.
